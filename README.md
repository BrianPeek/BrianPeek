# Hi, I'm Brian 👋

## 👨‍💻 About Me

- 🏢 Software engineer at [@Microsoft](https://github.com/microsoft) in the Xbox Advanced Technology Group (ATG).
- 🌐 Founder of [Ganksoft Entertainment](https://www.ganksoft.com/), an independent retro game development and publishing group creating games, tools, and emulators for consoles and PC.
- 🎮 Passionate about game development and retro gaming. I love building games for retro consoles and computers, and tinkering with classic hardware—especially the Atari Lynx.
- 🕹️ Always looking for ways to bridge the gap between modern software and classic gaming hardware, with a focus on platforms like the Atari Lynx and Sega Dreamcast.
- 🛠️ Creator of various tools, libraries, and homebrew games for gaming, hardware, and emulation.

## ⭐ What I’m currently working on

- Building and experimenting with homebrew projects for classic game consoles, with a special interest in the Atari Lynx and 6502 assembly programming.
- Designing and publishing original retro-inspired games, such as [Grogger for Atari Lynx](https://ganksoft.com/products/grogger/).
- Developing open source tools and libraries for hardware interfacing and game development.
- Exploring custom controllers and unique gaming peripherals, often using C, C++, and 6502 assembly.
